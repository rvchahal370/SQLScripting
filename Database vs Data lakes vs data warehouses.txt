Database vs Dataware House vs Data Lake
================================================

Database-
-------------------------------------------------------------

Store or works with the Transactional Data
OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
Structured Data
Recent Data- Day to Day Data
Example- Online Banking Transaction
databases are Oracle, MySql
Follows Schema on Write

Create Table Employee(
EmployeeId INT,
EmployeeName Varchar(50),
Salary int
)

Insert into Employee values(....)

During the insert it will compare the data with the table schema/Structure and if their is any mismatch it will throw an error.

Cost to store the data in database is high.

DatawareHouse- DWH
--------------------------------------------------

DatawareHouse can holds more data then DatawareHouse

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)- is a Technology that supports lasge business data and support complex analysis without negativelly affecting transactional systems.
its is used for Analytical Processing where we require lots of historical data to find the insights.

Why we are not using the Database for the Data Analytics?
Firstly cost will increase.
Secondaly, the moment we run complex queries on our database with an intent to do some Data Analytics the our current day to day transaction will become slow.
And our exising users will be impacted.

Thats why we take the data from database and migrate it to DatawareHouse to do some analytical processing.

In DatawareHouse we migrate the data from multiple sources.

Likewise Database, DatawareHouse is base on the structered Data and Schema on Write.

Example of DatawareHouse is TeraData

Overall Storage cost of datawareHouse is high but lesser than the cost of Database.

It follows ETL Process

E- Extract the Data from Database
T- Transform the data into specific format(Its is complex and time consuming process)
L- Load the data into DatawareHouse

ETL Process reduce our Flexibility because we must follow all the steps including Transformation, No matter we require or not.

Dala Lake-
--------------------------------------

Is used to get insights from huge amount of data.

In that, data is present in its raw format and and It can be structured and Unstructured.

Example:- we can directly can have log file in its raw format in the Data Lake.

It follows ELT process:- Extract, Load, Transform

Database Examples are HDFS, Amazon S3

It is cost effetive and follows Schema on Read.

Schema on Read means, first file like employee.csv will upload and then error check will be performed during the Creation of structure (to visualize or see the data).

It gives the user enough Flexibility.
