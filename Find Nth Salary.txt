Table has been given with the Employee ID and salary

In that case we have to find 2nd highest salary but if their is only one record than the system should return NULL

If their are two duplicate records (Example: 100, 100) than system should also return NULL for the 2nd highest salary

In process to find the Nth salary all duplicate records should be counted as single records
Example: For the salary 700 1st Highest Salary
                        600 2nd highest Salary
                        600 2nd Highest Salary
                        500 3rd Highest Salary
                        400 4th Highest Salary
                        300 5th Highest Salary

1st Possible Solution:

Select Max(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary from EmployeeSalary where Salary < (Select Max(Salary) from EmployeeSalary)

--It will not be appropriate if we will be having lots of records or if we want to find 5th or 6th highest salary


2nd Possible Solution:

Select Salary AS SecondHighestSalary from EmployeeSalary Order By Salary Desc Limit 1 Offset 1

Note: Offset means eliminitaing/descarding first record from the top, Limit 1 means only showing 1 record
--It will not be working at runtime because in case if there is only one salary record as 100 then it will return nothing but it should return NULL

Select IFNULL((Select Salary from EmployeeSalary Order By Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary

--It will also not be working when their will be only 2 salary duplicate records like 100, 100. Above query output will be 100 but it should be NULL

Select IFNULL(Select DISTINCT salary from EmployeeSalary Order By DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1 ) AS SecondHighestSalary

-- Now it will be throwing an correct information

3rd possible solution:

Select IFNULL(Select A.Salary from (select DISTINCT Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (Order By Salary DESC) AS Rank from EmployeeSalary) A where A.Rank = 2) AS SecondHighestSalary
